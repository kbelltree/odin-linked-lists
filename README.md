## The Odin Project: Linked Lists

This project involves implementing linked lists using class or factory functions to deepen an understanding of data structures in JavaScript. A linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, each contained in a node that links to the next element.

For more details on this project, please visit [The Odin Project - Project: Linked Lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists).

## Key Project Instructions:

Descriptions and usage details for these components are provided within the code comments in the source file.

### Two Classes or Factory Functions

The project consists of two main components:

- `LinkedList`
- `Node`

### List Management Functions

The following functions are to be implemented for managing the list:

- `append(value)`
- `prepend(value)`
- `size`
- `head`
- `tail`
- `at(index)`
- `pop`
- `contains(value)`
- `find(value)`
- `toString`

#### Extra Credit

Optionally, you can also implement:

- `insertAt(value, index)`
- `removeAt(index)`
